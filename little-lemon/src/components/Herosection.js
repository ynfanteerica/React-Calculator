                <p>Little  Lemon is a italian chain that operates across New York City. In nearly every sentence, the headline and description on its homepage stress that it is authentic italian foodâ€” not some cheap West Coast imitation. When your restaurant has a well-defined value prop like this, the description is no place for subtlety; you want to hammer it clearly, concisely and continuously. Baba's does this with text and then validates it with loud, in-your-face, food photography.</p>
